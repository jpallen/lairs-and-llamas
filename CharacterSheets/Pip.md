## Backstory

Pip never knew his parents—left on the doorstep of a Waterdhavian orphanage before his first birthday. When the orphanage burned down (an accident, he swears), he survived on the streets, running with gangs of child pickpockets and learning early that quick fingers meant a full belly.

By his teens, Pip had graduated from cutting purses to second-story work. He was good—maybe too good. A botched job at a noble's manor left him holding a ruby the size of a quail's egg and half the city watch on his tail. He fled Waterdeep and hasn't stopped moving since.

He encountered Aldric and Brynn in the town of Millhaven, initially planning to lift the dwarf's coin purse. Something stopped him—maybe the way they looked out for each other, maybe just the promise of regular meals. When they invited him to join their travels, he said yes before he could think better of it. He still has the ruby, hidden in his boot, waiting for the right fence.
