## Backstory

Brynn served as a healer-priest at the Temple of Moradin's Hearth in the dwarven city of Karak Durn for nearly a century. Content in her role tending to miners and smiths, she never sought advancement—until she discovered the high priest had been skimming donations meant for the poor.

When she reported the corruption, she was accused of heresy and quietly exiled rather than believed. The temple elders found it easier to remove one troublesome acolyte than to expose their leader's sins. Brynn left Karak Durn with her faith in Moradin intact but her trust in religious institutions shattered.

She encountered Aldric on the road, the human soldier near death from his wounds. Healing him gave her purpose again—Moradin's work didn't require temples or hierarchies. Now she travels with him, bringing the Soulforger's light to those who need it most.
