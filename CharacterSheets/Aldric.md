## Backstory

Aldric served fifteen years in the Lionguard, the elite infantry of the kingdom of Valdris. He rose to the rank of sergeant, leading a squad through countless skirmishes along the borderlands. When his unit was ambushed by gnolls, Aldric was the only survivor—saved by a wandering cleric who found him bleeding out among the dead.

The experience shattered something in him. Unable to return to military life, he resigned his commission and took to wandering, seeking purpose. He met Brynn during his recovery—the dwarf's pragmatic faith helping him find meaning again. When Brynn spoke of joining an adventuring company, Aldric saw a chance to protect others once more, this time on his own terms.
