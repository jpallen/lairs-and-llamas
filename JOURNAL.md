# Campaign Journal

## Session 1

The party — Aldric Stoneheart (Human Fighter), Brynn Ironforge (Dwarf Life Cleric), and Pip Thornbury (Halfling Rogue) — were traveling the road to Cyndervale when they spotted smoke rising from the forest. They investigated and discovered a halfling campsite under attack. One wagon was burned out and two orcs were rummaging through another.

Pip snuck around the clearing to the far side (Stealth 19), where he discovered Milo Fairfoot hiding with his two children, Lila and Tobin. The party set up an ambush: Pip created a distraction, drawing the orcs' attention, while Aldric hurled his shield (improvised weapon, 6 damage) at one orc and Brynn obliterated the other with Guiding Bolt (16 radiant damage, instant kill). Pip then finished the wounded orc with a shortbow sneak attack from hiding (13 damage). Both orcs killed.

Milo emerged and explained that orcs had kidnapped his wife Esmie and his parents. He pointed out a trail leading deeper into the forest. Pip immediately bolted up the trail before anyone could stop him.

At the orc lair entrance (A2), Pip found an ornate dwarven mine entrance with two wolves chained outside. His attempt to calm them with food failed (Animal Handling 7 vs DC 15) and the wolves began barking, alerting an orc inside. Aldric and Brynn arrived as the orc charged out. Aldric shoved the orc back into the wolves' reach (Athletics contest won), and the frenzied brown wolf bit the orc (5 damage) and knocked it prone. Brynn smashed it with her warhammer (6 damage) and Pip finished it with a shortsword sneak attack (7 damage). Orc killed.

After combat, Brynn successfully calmed and befriended both wolves (Animal Handling 20 vs DC 15). The wolves are thin and poorly treated by the orcs. The party now stands at the entrance to the torchlit dwarven mine.

**Party status:** All at full HP. Brynn has 1/2 spell slots remaining (used Guiding Bolt). Aldric recovered his shield after throwing it in the first fight.

The party entered the mine tunnel (A3) with the two befriended wolves in tow. The passage sloped downward, lined with fine dwarven stonework and torches. Aldric read old dwarven blessings to Moradin carved into the walls. They discovered a broken-open storage room in the south wall, but it had been thoroughly looted. The tunnel continues ahead to a set of large open wooden double doors.

The party searched the tunnel walls. Pip found nothing (Perception 2), but Aldric noticed something off about one section of the north wall (Perception 14). Brynn confirmed it — her dwarven stonecunning revealing a hidden door with cool air seeping through the cracks (Perception 17). She pushed it open, revealing a narrow unlit 10-foot passage with a faint chemical smell.

Aldric lit a torch and stepped into the secret passage (A3-1). He spotted a nearly invisible gelatinous cube filling the entire tunnel, oozing toward him (Perception 17 vs DC 15). He shouted a warning. Initiative rolled: Gelatinous Cube 12, Brynn 10, Aldric 9, Pip 6. The cube oozed forward but couldn't reach Aldric in time. Aldric fell back into the main tunnel and slammed the secret door shut. The cube pressed against it briefly then retreated. The party chose not to engage and sealed the passage. Brynn whistled for the wolves to join them, and the full party assembled at the threshold of the open double doors leading deeper into the mine. They proceeded through into A4, a large pillared hallway — the central hub of the mine. Three exits: large double doors east (firelight and a rumbling voice), a smaller open door north (grunting and snoring), and a barricaded door south covered in orcish script.

Pip attempted to decipher the orcish writing on the barricaded southern door, drawing on fragments of the language he'd learned from a half-orc friend during his street days. His attempt was only partially successful (Intelligence check 8 with disadvantage) — he recognised it as a warning of danger, but couldn't make out the specific threat. The party noted that the orcs had clearly barricaded something *in* rather than keeping intruders out.
